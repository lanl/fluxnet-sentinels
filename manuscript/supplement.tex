\noindent Table S1: All possible pairwise combinations of dependent and independent variables for the IRE case study (n=51). $R^2$ is the coefficient of determination of a linear model fit to the two covariates for the entirety of the period of record (not specific to any window in Fig. 2). Effect is the event effect size of the interaction term 'during' the known release period matching the 100\% quantile of the distribution.

\noindent Table S2: All possible pairwise combinations of dependent and independent variables for the Fukushima case study (n=51) for screening of candidate variable pairs. $R^2$ is the coefficient of determination of a linear model fit to the two covariates for the entirety of the period of record (not specific to any window in Fig. 2). Effect is the event effect size of the interaction term 'during' the known release period matching the 100\% quantile of the distribution.
